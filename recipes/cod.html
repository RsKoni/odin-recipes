    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Mediterranean baked cod is a simple recipe for adding Mediterranean flavor to flaky, healthy, baked cod. Topped with a lemony mix of olives, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes, itâ€™s quick and easy enough for the ultimate weeknight dinner, but impressive enough for guests.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds cod filets</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Greek seasoning</li>
        <li>1/3 cup pitted Kalamata olives</li>
        <li>1/3 cup roughly chopped drained artichoke hearts in brine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup julienned drained sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly-squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or as needed</li>
        <li>4 fresh lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees F). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li> Pat fish filets dry with a paper towel. Place cod on the baking sheet, lightly coat the tops with olive oil, and sprinkle with Greek seasoning.</li>
        <li> In a small bowl, combine Kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, lemon juice, and garlic. Evenly spoon the mixture over the filets.</li>
        <li> Bake until cod flakes easily with a fork, 14 to 16 minutes. The internal temperature, measured with an instant-read thermometer, should reach 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Baking time may vary slightly depending on the thickness of filets.</li>
        <li> Carefully remove cod and topping to a serving dish using a large spatula. Garnish with chopped parsley, and serve immediately with a wedge of lemon.</li>
    </ol>
